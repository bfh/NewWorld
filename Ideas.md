Each settlement is a “unit” somewhat like a dwarf in dwarf fortress or a person in RimWorld. With their own needs and abilities. As their population grows they can do more tasks. They fulfil their needs with nearby hexes if they can, if not they may trade with other settlements. If they cannot do that either they will suffer penalties such as a shrinking population.

Heroes: Heroes are specific modifiers for a settlement that can be assigned to one. They confer special effects to it for a limited time.
