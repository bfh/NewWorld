# NewWorld
This Game will be set in a Steampunk-fantasy world. You control a group of settlers that have made their way to an unexplored continent. They will  have to fight the native land every step of the way in order to survive and thrive in this *new world*.
You control your civilisation through simple orders, you do not have direct control over your units.
It will have simple 2d graphics. Consisting mostly of the World map. important locations such as settlements, ruins, valuable resources or outposts will be represented by Icons.


We need to determine if the game will be in real time or turn based. Turn based would probably be easier to make.
