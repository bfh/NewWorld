# NewWorld description
This Game will be set in a Steampunk-fantasy world. You control a group of settlers that have made their way to an unexplored continent. They will  have to fight the native land every step of the way in order to survive and thrive in this *new world*.
You control your civilisation through simple orders, you do not have direct control over your units.
Challenges to overcome include: Disease, Wild natives (e.g. Orks, goblins and the like), more civilised Natives (Technologically on a comparable level), Ancient magical things (e.g. a dragon, a living mountain, ancient ruins that hold a devastating power)…

It will have simple 2d graphics. Consisting mostly of the World map. important locations such as settlements, ruins, valuable resources or outposts will be represented by Icons.

# MVP (minimal viable product)
You spawn on a fixed map and expand your civilisation over all of it. There are no limitating factors hindering you.

# To-do
- Native or web?
- What framework do we use? Unity?
- What language do we use?

- Determine if the game will be in real time or turn based. Turn based would probably be easier to make. 

## Add your ideas for the game here
Each settlement is a “unit” somewhat like a dwarf in dwarf fortress or a person in RimWorld. With their own needs and abilities. As their population grows they can do more tasks. They fulfil their needs with nearby hexes if they can, if not they may trade with other settlements. If they cannot do that either they will suffer penalties such as a shrinking population.

Heroes: Heroes are specific modifiers for a settlement that can be assigned to one. They confer special effects to it for a limited time.
